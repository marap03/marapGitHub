<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Mara. This is the first website I have ever built. It was an assignment given to me in my coding class. I am a part of Girls who code in Decorah, Iowa. This website is a website all about me, so I'll tell you about myself.</p>
<br>
<p>I live in Decorah with my mom, dad, and cat Odin. I really enjoy coding (especially this website). I also like dancing, art, and the outdoors, but my favorite hobby is aerial pilates. Now, you might be wondering what aerial is (I get that a lot!), so i'll explain it. Its kinda like the stuff that acrobats do in the circus. I hang fron silkds, and do tricks on the trapese. Its a lot of fun.</p>

<p>I also love traveling. I' been to so many states I can't keep track anymore. The last trip I went on was to South Dakota. It was so much fun! On our way there we stopped at a lot of cool places like The Green Giant in Blue Earth, Minnesota, and Wall Drug in Keystone, South Dakota. My favorite kind of traveling is when we go camping. This summer I went to the Upper Penninsula of Michigan. We camped there for three nights and it was so much fun!</p>
